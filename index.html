                    <p class="intro"><b>Unofficially</b>, I code games and websites, think about users, play with Arduinos and talk about synthetic biology.</p>

                        <p id="description-website1" class="descriptions">I designed the UX and coded the UCL 2017’s iGEM <a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://2017.igem.org/Team:UCL">website</a>. Vanilla HTML, CSS with Bootstrap and JS. Looking forward to using React for the next project.</p>

                        <p id="description-website2" class="descriptions">Special thanks to Anima Sutradhar for the diagrams and artwork, and together with Rabia T Khan and Jaime Domingues for help, advice and suggestions on the UX.</p>

                        <p id="description-website3" class="descriptions">You can download some of the wireframes that I made when designing the UX. As a newbie to it, I didn't use any professional software, but went for something quick and practical and would get everyone in the team an idea of what content needs producing.</p>

                        <p id="description-games1" class="descriptions">Part of my iGEM project, I wanted to communicate science through a story.</p>
                        <p id="description-games2" class="descriptions">That’s where games and interactive installations came into play. I had 1 month to build something that would impress the London Science Museum Lates team. Using the lovely place the Institute of Making is and p5.js, I went for 2 arcade games to gamify the central dogma of molecular biology.</p>
                        <p id="description-games3" class="descriptions">Since you’ll need to come to London to experience the Bacterial Dance, you can use my code and turn it into your own biology gamification:</p>

                        <p id="description-games4" class="descriptions">I thought games would be a great way to engage in science communication. Also, games nowadays are all about being in your room and not socialising. This was about getting a partner, not in 2 separate bedrooms, but one next to each other.</p>
                        <p id="description-games5" class="descriptions">I looked at how my own learning of molecular biology happened - long hours spent reading about nucleotides and their interactions. But what would be a great way to illustrate this?</p>
                        <p id="description-games6" class="descriptions">The aim was to get an intuition about how to build games so that I can apply that skill in the future.</p>


                        <p id="description-games7" class="descriptions">Initially, I designed a couple of ideas: a live quorum sensing game, where people around London would have to use their phones to produce a phenotype.</p>
                        <p id="description-games8" class="descriptions">I also wanted to use colour adaptation headsets, which would have people decode DNA pairs from each other.</p>
                        <p id="description-games9" class="descriptions">Finally, I settled on the Dance Dance Revolution and arcade game, after considering the most feasible solution given time and money, as well as what’d turn out to be the most fun for people to play.</p>

                        <p id="description-games10" class="descriptions">At the event, I asked people what they thought about the installation. I was interested in seeing whether they see it as a potential educational tool, just as something for fun and what could be improved.</p>
                        <p id="description-games11" class="descriptions">A school teacher asked us to come to the local school and have pupils play with the installation.</p>
                        <p id="description-games12" class="descriptions">The project turned out to be quite a successful one, learning about building simple hardware solutions, connecting that to software and learning what game design involves. In the spare time I’m trying to optimise the game to have one feed into another via Websockets with a Node server.</p>

                        <p class="descriptions">In my 3rd year I tested what factors can break the 4th wall of cognitive science with the use of narratives and eye-tracking.</p>

                        <p class="descriptions">I looked at how a storyteller’s eye gaze, whether they refer to the receiver directly (you vs he) and whether the person believed they were seen or not, affected immersion into the narrative and overt attention allocation (where one looks).</p>

                        <p class="descriptions">Results showed that exploring theories of direct eye contact and storytelling is a worthwhile future pursuit, especially in applying some of the effects in the design of storytelling.</p>
