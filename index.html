                        <p id="description-website1" class="descriptions">I designed the UX and coded the UCL 2017’s iGEM <a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://2017.igem.org/Team:UCL">website</a>. Vanilla HTML, CSS with Bootstrap and JS. Looking forward to using React for the next project.</p>

                        <p id="description-website2" class="descriptions">Special thanks to Anima Sutradhar for the diagrams and artwork, and together with Rabia T Khan and Jaime Domingues for help, advice and suggestions on the UX.</p>

                        <p id="description-website3" class="descriptions">You can download some of the wireframes that I made when designing the UX. As a newbie to it, I didn't use any professional software, but went for something quick and practical and would get everyone in the team an idea of what content needs producing.</p>

                        <p id="description-website4" class="descriptions">The whole website took around 3 months from the first ideas, to wireframes, initial designs, agreeing on a structure and theme with the team, creating content, refining, testing UX and dealing with iGEM’s ridiculous rules about website hosting.</p>

                        <p id="description-website5" class="descriptions">From the start, I wanted to build a website that wasn’t just pretty, but one that satisfied the purpose of our project: serve as a wiki for people to build upon it, access information and have a pleasant reading experience. </p>

                        <p id="description-website6" class="descriptions">Also, given the limitations with iGEM website hosting, I decided to use vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. However, along the way, the most interesting part was the challenge of designing good UX.</p>

                        <p id="description-website7" class="descriptions">Here are some of the wireframes for the home and project description pages. It was a lengthy process of design, going back and forth between the person who was designing the diagrams and visuals, what the die-hard biologists wanted to put on the first page and myself. However, I felt like it helped me come up with alternative solutions and understand why some parts of the project were important.</p>

                        <p id="description-website8" class="descriptions">I did not use any professional tools for UX, relying on a way to prototype quickly and practically, while getting everyone in the team on the same page in terms of what content needs to be produced.</p>

                        <p id="description-website9" class="descriptions">My first web development gig  helped me build the necessary tools to deploy a website, undertake a lengthy process with specific deliverables and work towards satisfying my‘clients’ (as I call the iGEM judges and my team mates). </p>

                        <p id="description-website10" class="descriptions">The skills proved useful, as recently I used them in a hackathon (see the Hatch London page) to build a prototype for an online platform.</p>

                        <p id="description-games1" class="descriptions">During my iGEM project, I was curious how games can be used to tell a story about synthetic biology and enhance science communication.</p>
                        <p id="description-games2" class="descriptions">I had 1 month to build an installation that would impress the London Science Museum Lates team enough to be part of their evening. After a few sketches, I decided to design and make from scratch 2 games to gamify the central dogma of molecular biology. After all the fun, I turned the project into an iterative process, which I am still working on now to develop.</p>
                        <p id="description-games3" class="descriptions">To read about the process and all the whys, click below. <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://github.com/darksipu/cell-games">Here</a>’s the GitHub to build your own.</p>

                        <p id="description-games4" class="descriptions">I started with 3 ideas for the installation: give an intuitive understanding of the concept, get people excited about the idea and also transform the experience of gaming from an isolated bedroom nerd to resembling games that you’d play around the Christmas table. My hypothesis was that such a combination would be well received.</p>
                        <p id="description-games5" class="descriptions">But arcade games are still so fun. So, I tried to design something that has the fun of traditional video games, adds a social component and is a useful gateway into synthetic biology.</p>
                        <p id="description-games6" class="descriptions">Also, I wanted to couple my newly learnt molecular biology with something that had wanted to do for a while: hardware. While at the time I was comfortable with writing code, I was not sure how my Mac talked to an Arduino and I wanted to have fun while learning that.</p>


                        <p id="description-games7" class="descriptions">Here are some of my sketches. Initially, I got inspired by work that I did for my 3rd year project about breaking the 4th wall in experiencing media and wanted to make people part of the scientific concept that I wanted to communicate. So, the idea of a live quorum sensing exercise came, where I sketched a web app that used live geolocation to have people come together in close areas to produce phenotypes. I thought about how this could be applied to charity events as well.</p>
                        <p id="description-games8" class="descriptions">However, for the London Science Museum there was a constraint of space and I had limited time on hand. So, I moved to something that would really help someone understand what biology is all about: the central dogma. That really helped me understand what ‘DNA codes for protein’ means.</p>
                        <p id="description-games9" class="descriptions">I settled on the central dogma, but combined it with something that’d satisfy all the conditions and constraints. So, I thought that we’d pair up transcription as a Dance Dance revolution game with translation, as an arcade game. The two would communicate between each other and so players would get a chance to see how the 2 processes are connected in bacterial cells.</p>

                        <p id="description-games10" class="descriptions">By the time of the event I learnt about the difficulties in making a product that is used by the end users and does not break. On September 27th, the timing to combine the two games was not ready yet, so their gameplay could not be linked. However, people still tried the games in pairs and I supplemented the experience by engaging more with the audience and explaining the purpose of the installation.</p>
                        <p id="description-games11" class="descriptions">A school teacher asked me to take the installation to a local school in London and I got participants throughout the night to answer a few questions about the potential of the project. I was particularly interested in seeing what their feedback was on learning something about biology, the social component and whether they would take interest in the topic in the near future. </p>
                        <p id="description-games12" class="descriptions">Overall, it was an important project to me, both on the level of ideas about what I would like to do next and skills wise. I became comfortable with building physical things and finding solutions along the way (e.g. in the design of the dance pad). Importantly, I was lucky to go through the iterative process of designing the 2 games, learning about how to accommodate to a user’s needs.</p>
                        <p id="description-games13" class="descriptions">My next plan with Cell Games, as I like to call them, is to work on the quorum sensing sketch and try to break the 4th wall in science communication. Now, I’m still trying to optimise the feedback between the games with Websockets via an Express server, so shoot me an email if you’d like to contribute!</p>

                        <p class="descriptions">I think a lot about how we experience and perceive the world around us. So, the concept of breaking the 4th wall in theatre appealed to me and wanted to test it in cognitive science. My 3rd year project focused on using narratives and eye-tracking to see whether eye gaze and storytelling have a common thread to explore.</p>

                        <p class="descriptions">The experiment manipulated the storyteller’s gaze, self-referencing through language and whether the person believe that they were seen or not by the storyteller. I started from theories of self-referencing and direct eye gaze perception and chose to look at the levels of immersion into the narrative and over attention allocation.</p>

                        <p class="descriptions">Results motivated me to still think about how direct eye gaze can contribute in storytelling, especially in designing experiences that leverage what we know about its effects. While further research is needed to assess the exact effects of eye gaze, I am sure that the joint exploration of storytelling, eye gaze and media experiences is a worthwhile one. <a style="text-decoration: none" href="assets/FlorinGheorghiuDissertation.pdf" download>Here</a> you can download the dissertation.</p>
